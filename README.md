# ü¶ú PARROT

<!-- Provide a quick summary of the dataset. -->

![PARROT Overview](./parrot-website-logo.png)

PARROT (**P**ractical **A**nd **R**ealistic Benchma**R**k for Cr**O**ss-System SQL **T**ranslation) was created to support the task of Cross-System SQL Translation (i.e., SQL-to-SQL translation), 
which involves adapting a query written for one database system into its functionally equivalent form for another. 
The main dataset comprises 598 translation pairs from 38 open-source benchmarks and real-world business services, 
specifically prepared to challenge system-specific SQL understanding.

‚Ä† **Hybrid** means the dataset was created using both automatic generation and manual annotation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è 2. Uses

<!-- Address questions around how the dataset is intended to be used. -->

### 2.1 Direct Use

<!-- This section describes suitable use cases for the dataset. -->

PARROT supports direct in various manners.
Below, we showcase how to load it with `datasets` library.

```
from datasets import load_dataset

# Login using e.g. `huggingface-cli login` to access this dataset
ds = load_dataset("weizhoudb/PARROT")
```

## üß© 3. Dataset Creation

### 3.1 Curation Rationale

<!-- Motivation for the creation of this dataset. -->

PARROT intends to construct a realistic and challenging benchmark for evaluating cross-dialect SQL translation. 
The collected queries pass through a rigorous curation pipeline that retains only those queries satisfying Jim Gray‚Äôs four benchmark design principles.

- **(1) Relevance:** PARROT covers a wide range of cross-system SQL translation cases, including different operator complexities. 
- **(2) Simplicity:** PARROT is designed to eliminate redundant SQLs and be easily understandable.
- **(3) Portability:** PARROT is applicable to different translation scenarios (e.g., with different source / target data systems).
- **(4) Scalability:** PARROT includes real datasets of different data sizes and distributions, allowing it to simulate various incoming data sizes and changing patterns.

### 3.2 Annotation process

<!-- This section describes the annotation process such as annotation tools used in the process, the amount of data annotated, annotation guidelines provided to the annotators, interannotator statistics, annotation validation, etc. -->

The annotation process combines automated transformation with manual validation to ensure the accuracy and functional equivalence of SQL translations. 

First, SQL queries from various benchmarks and real-world services are anonymized at the entity, field, and query levels to remove sensitive information while preserving structure.
Next, candidate translations are generated using a combination of rule-based translation tools and LLM-assisted methods. 
Each translation is then manually reviewed and, if necessary, corrected by experienced annotators to ensure that it adheres to the syntax of the target dialect and preserves the semantics of the source query.
Finally, all annotated pairs are validated through execution tests (when applicable) and heuristic checks to confirm correctness across dialects.
